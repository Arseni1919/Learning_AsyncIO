# Learning Async IO

## About [Async IO](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)

Async IO is a concurrent programming design that has received dedicated support in Python,
evolving rapidly from Python 3.4 through 3.7, and probably beyond.

`asyncio` is a library to write concurrent code using the `async`/`await` syntax.

`asyncio` is used as a foundation for multiple Python asynchronous frameworks
that provide high-performance network and web-servers,
database connection libraries, distributed task queues, etc.

`asyncio` is often a perfect fit for IO-bound and high-level structured network code.
